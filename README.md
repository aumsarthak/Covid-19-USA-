# Covid-19-USA-
ðŸŒŸExcel Project
ðŸ‘‰I just created Microsoft Excel project of COVID - 19 US which shows the detailed attrition analysis of COVID in different regions.
 â–ª In this project, I collected data from COVID Worldometers and converted it into a dynamic dashboard

ðŸ“ŒCOVID-19 US Dashboard Analysis
The provided dashboard offers a comprehensive view of COVID-19 data across various US states, highlighting key metrics and trends. Here's a detailed analysis of its components, insights, and conclusions:

ðŸ“ŒKey Components
1. Summary Statistics 
Number of US States: 56
Total Population: 332 million
Total COVID Cases: 108.5 million
Total Recovered: 96.26 million
Total Deaths: 1.16 million
Total Active Cases: 570.9 thousand
Total Tests: 1.177 million

2. Top 5 States with Total and Active Cases (Bar and Line Chart)
Texas: 8.97M total cases, 38.4K active cases
New York: 7.43M total cases, 54.6K active cases
Ohio: 3.46M total cases, 49.1K active cases
Michigan: 3.27M total cases, 42.7K active cases
New Jersey: 3.22M total cases, 68.4K active cases

3. Top 5 States with Total Population and Total Cases (Stacked Bar Chart)
California: 39.51M population, 12.54M total cases
Florida: 21.48M population, 7.91M total cases
New York: 19.45M population, 7.43M total cases
Pennsylvania: 12.80M population, 3.57M total cases
Texas: 29.00M population, 8.97M total cases

4. Top 5 States by Recovery and Death Percentages (Doughnut Chart)
âˆ˜ Recovery Percentage:
California: 25%
Florida: 19%
New York: 12%
Pennsylvania: 9%
Texas: 20%
âˆ˜ Death Percentage:
California: 22%
Florida: 22%
New York: 31%
Pennsylvania: 22%
Texas: 22%

5. State-Specific Data 
Example for Alabama:
Total Population: 4,903,185
Total COVID Cases: 1,659,936
Active Cases: 14,863
Total Recovered: 1,623,935
Total Deaths: 21,138

ðŸ“ŒInsights
1. High Impact States:
âž¢Texas and California show significantly higher total cases and active cases, likely due to their large populations.
âž¢New York has a notable number of active cases relative to total cases, indicating ongoing challenges in controlling the virus.

2. Recovery and Mortality Rates:
âž¢California and Texas show balanced recovery and death percentages, suggesting effective health responses.
âž¢New York has the highest death percentage (31%), indicating a severe impact during the pandemic's peak.

3. Population vs. Case Distribution:
âž¢States with larger populations (California, Texas) naturally show higher case numbers but also demonstrate substantial recovery efforts.
âž¢States like Pennsylvania and Ohio have lower total cases relative to population, possibly due to effective containment measures.

ðŸ“ŒConclusion

âž¢The dashboard effectively highlights the diverse impact of COVID-19 across US states. Larger states with higher populations experienced more significant case numbers but also demonstrate strong recovery efforts. Key insights reveal critical areas for ongoing health initiatives, particularly in states with higher active cases and death percentages. This data can inform policy decisions and resource allocation to manage and mitigate the pandemic's effects.
